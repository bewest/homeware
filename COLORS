I'm trying the solarized color scheme.
It requires a fair bit of customization.  Xterm doesn't go
into 256 color mode, and you need to get xterm, screen,
and vim to all agree on the terminal type.

Here are some helpful reminders:
  * tput colors # prints number of colors
  * TERM=xterm-256color # should trigger the right term
    cap entries
  * sudo apt-get install ncurses-term # install term
    entries for 256 colors

VIM

Easiest to use pathogen.
Debug solarized this way:

Check what t_Co vim has picked up from your term emulator
(a quick :echo &t_Co). If it's 8 you'll want to se
t_Co=16. You might also try se t_Co=256 though without let
g:solarized_termcolors=16 this will use the 256 fallback
mode, which isn't quite the correct color scheme.

:colorscheme solarized
:set background=light
:set background=dark


When configured correctly, this inverts the colors
schemes.

XTERM

Setting $TERM in the shell profile is generally a bad
idea, since you may wish to use different terminals. It is
preferable to add it to .Xdefaults (or similar file read
by X applications):

XTerm*termName:         xterm-256color

xterm-blue
xterm-light

SCREEN
