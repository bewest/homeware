Deploying
=========

Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Assume there is a server already running with a git/hg repo.

Deploying goes something like:

  Capistrano / Fabric:
  https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki
  http://stii.co.za/python/switched-to-python-fabric/
    Wraps common commands into composable tasks.
    
    * copy branch changes to deploy branch
    * update running instances with new code
    * monitor/list/create instances
  
  Capistrano: Ruby, very popular
  Fabric: python, newer, less mature

Starting Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom debian packages are hosted in launchpad, and cloudinit.  Cloudinit will
add the appropriate PPAs and install the right packages automatically using APT.

APT packages are maintained using simple text files.

Launchpad itself is opensource and run in EC2, which means they have lots of
useful notes.
