I'm having trouble getting a recent version of matplotlib.
Debian ships < 1.0 and I need at least 1.0.  The latest
release is 1.0.1.x.

Long ago I installed it from source on my laptop, and
failed to take notes on the steps required to reproduce.
There are two PPAs from individuals that have been working
on getting MPL included in ubuntu's natty, which will
unlock upgrades for everyone.

Please merge matplotlib 1.0.1-1 (universe) from debian
experimental main 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/matplotlib/+bug/607395

1.0.1 is available from a debian archive:
http://packages.debian.org/experimental/python-matplotlib
