-----

The OL modifications need serverside support.  Would help
to package as independent library.  Name might be
euclidean-ui??? eucliui?

It's based on Raskin's concept of pan/zoom interfaces
focusing on panning and zooming to help trigger our
navigating instincts.

More project ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * lb-fastcgi ? would be nice to have a fastcgi to manage
    lighttpd's entire backend pool.  Combined with a
    monitoring solution a hypothetical UI would allow you
    to configure and monitor the backends of a webserver.
  * hello-music: A suite of primers on music.

    * hello-rhythm
      * measuring time
        * counting
        * rests vs sounding
      * generating pulses
        * subdividing
      * introducing notation
      * finding beats

    * music-exposition: A set of tools, maybe an
      application, to create / view a presentation of
      music.  The presentation should enable scrolling
      across a representation of music as the music plays,
      and should allow compiling multimedia from a variety
      of sources.  Uses sphinx/cherrypy/eucliui.
